# ABSTRACT: Run Statocles commands
package statocles;
$statocles::VERSION = '0.031';
# Mojolicious::Commands currently calls GetOptions and clobbers a few of
# our command-line options. Since I don't want to rely on the envvars
# that get set in that process, we'll do this little dance here.
#
# This happens because we build a Mojolicious app inside the Statocles::Command
# module, which loads Mojolicious, which loads Mojolicious::Commands, which
# calls GetOptions on @ARGV
my @argv;
BEGIN { @argv = @ARGV };
