NAME
    Statocles - A static site generator

VERSION
    version 0.008

DESCRIPTION
    Statocles is a tool for building static HTML pages from documents.

  DOCUMENTS
    A document is a data structure. The default store reads documents in a
    combined YAML and Markdown format.

    Documents are formatted with a YAML document on top, and Markdown
    content on the bottom, like so:

        ---
        title: This is a title
        author: preaction
        ---
        # This is the markdown content
    
        This is a paragraph

    This is the same format that Jekyll <http://jekyllrb.com> uses. The
    document format is described in the Statocles::Store documentation under
    Frontmatter Document Format.

  PAGES
    A Statocles::Page is rendered HTML ready to be sent to a user.

    Statocles::Page::Document
        This page renders a single document.

    Statocles::Page::List
        This page renders a list of other pages (not documents).

APPLICATIONS
    An application takes a bunch of documents and turns them into HTML
    pages.

    Statocles::App::Blog
        A simple blogging application.

SITES
    A Statocles::Site manages a bunch of applications, writing and deploying
    the resulting pages.

    Deploying the site may involve a simple file copy, but it could also
    involve a Git repository, an FTP site, or a database.

    Statocles::Site::Git
        A simple Git repository site.

STORES
    A Statocles::Store reads and writes documents and pages. The default
    store reads documents in YAML and writes pages to a file, but stores
    could read documents as JSON, or from a Mongo database, and write pages
    to a database, or whereever you want!
